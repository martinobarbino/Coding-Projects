The directory entitled 'Final Projects' contains projects that are much more extensive in scale and more detailed. 
The directory entitled 'CS50w Projects' contains projects I did in CS50w. The scope of these projects did not warrant the creation of a readme, but I did record videos demonstrating how these projects work.
The directory entitled 'CS50x Projects' contains projects I did in CS50x, these were much smaller in scale.
The directory entitled 'Java Programming 1' contains projects I did in my SPC Java Programming 1 course.
