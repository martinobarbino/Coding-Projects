# Description of Directories:

#### Final Projects:
Final projects from various classes. These are the largest in scope and the most detailed.

#### CS50w Projects:
Projects from Harvard's CS50w online course. These projects were quite large in scope and dealt mostly with web development. The project specifications did not instruct to create a README,
but each project does have a video demonstrating the project in operation.

#### CS50x Projects:
Projects from Harvard's CS50x online course. These projects were smaller in scope, and tended to be focused on basic programming problems. These do not contain readmes or descriptions.

#### Java Programming 1 Projects:
Projects from my Java Programming 1 class at Saint Paul College. These projects were relatively small in scope, and documentation comments were sometimes required throughout the projects.
